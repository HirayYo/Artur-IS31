### > Who is this file intended for

This file is intended for regular Spotify users, not for developers.

It will be interesting:

- Existing Spotify users
- New Spotify users
- Managers and stakeholders

The goal is to provide a general understanding of how Spotify works, its main functions and features.

### Basic Entities in Spotify

1. User (User):
 - This is your personal Spotify account. Your information is stored here: name, email, profile photo, etc.
 - You can log in and out of your account, change your profile, and delete your account.

2. Musical composition (Track):
- This is a separate song or track that you can listen to.
 - Each track has a title, artist, album, duration, genre and a link to play.
 - You can start, pause, rewind tracks, as well as add or remove them from playlists.

3. Playlist:
 - This is a set of musical compositions that you can create, edit and delete.
 - The playlist has a title, description, creation date and author.
 - You can add and remove tracks from playlists.

4. Performer (Artist):
 - This is a musician or a group that performs musical compositions.
 - The artist has a name, profile photo, number of subscribers and genres of music.
 - You can view the artist's top tracks, albums and upcoming concerts.

5. Album:
Is a collection of musical compositions released by the artist.
 - The album has a title, artist, release date, track list and total duration.
 - You can add albums to your library or delete them from there.

6. Podcast:
 - This is a series of audio episodes on a specific topic that you can listen to.
 - The podcast has a title, description, host, number of episodes and total duration.
 - You can start listening to a podcast, add or remove it from your library.

#### These basic objects represent the key elements that you will interact with in the Spotify app. They allow you to listen to music, manage playlists, explore artists and albums, as well as podcasts.

This is how these objects interact:

1. You, as a User, log into your account and interact with all other objects.
2. You can search and listen to Music tracks, add them to Playlists or to your personal Library.
3. You can view information about Artists and Albums, as well as add them to your Library.
4. You can also listen to Podcasts, add them to your Library or delete them from there.

In this way, Spotify allows you to fully manage your music collection and access millions of tracks, albums, artists and podcasts.
